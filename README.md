Welcome to my GitHub! I’m an emerging software developer passionate about building, breaking, and learning through real-world projects. This space serves as my digital lab — where curiosity meets code.

Here, you'll find:

💡 Personal experiments exploring new technologies, frameworks, and tools

🚀 Mini-projects that demonstrate what I'm learning

📘 Documented journeys of problem-solving and growth in software development

🌐 Collaborations and contributions as I step deeper into the open-source world


I'm constantly exploring topics across web development, AI/ML, and modern tech stacks, and believe in learning by doing. Feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are always welcome!

“Code. Learn. Repeat.”
